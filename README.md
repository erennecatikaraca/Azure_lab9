# Analyze Data with SQL - Azure Synapse Analytics Lab

Welcome to the **Analyze Data with SQL** lab for **Azure Synapse Analytics**. This lab is designed to help you master SQL queries and perform data analysis tasks in a cloud-based environment using Azure Synapse. By following through this lab, you'll gain practical experience in data analysis, querying large datasets, and leveraging SQL to extract meaningful insights.

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you will work through various SQL tasks that will help you gain a deep understanding of how to:
- Load and manage data within Azure Synapse Analytics
- Write SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data
- Perform various types of data analysis including filtering, grouping, and summarizing
- Work with advanced SQL techniques like JOINs, subqueries, and data types

By the end of this lab, you'll have hands-on experience in the core concepts of SQL data analysis and will be able to apply these skills to real-world datasets in Azure Synapse.

## Key Learning Areas:
- **Data Loading**: Learn how to load datasets into Azure Synapse Analytics and prepare them for querying.
- **SQL Queries**: Write basic and complex SQL queries to filter, join, and aggregate data effectively.
- **Data Aggregation & Grouping**: Use SQL functions to summarize data, group it by different attributes, and calculate aggregates.
- **Advanced SQL Techniques**: Work with JOIN operations, subqueries, and other advanced SQL techniques to handle complex data analysis tasks.
- **Data Transformation**: Learn to transform and clean datasets, apply different filters, and work with different data types.

## What Youâ€™ll Do:
- **Step-by-step SQL Queries**: Execute a series of SQL queries to extract, analyze, and manipulate data.
- **Hands-on Experience**: You will apply SQL commands in real-time to perform data analysis on large datasets.
- **Visual Data Results**: View the results of your queries visually and understand how SQL affects the data at each stage.
- **Collaborative Learning**: Follow the lab steps and share your findings with others.
